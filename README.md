#CSS Code Cheat Sheet Website
##Our Second Mini Project
###By Alex Hernandez and Jonathan Guevara

#Description

The website displays a cheat sheet wherein there are six panels containing snippets of CSS code for various interesting effects. When the mouse hovers over the title of any panel, there is a glow animation effect.

It took quite a while to make this website. Some of the issues that formed walls were the flex property, glow animation, and IDs/Classes not communicating between CSS stylesheet and HTML. In the end, however, with a lot of work, we overcame these obstacles. We were inspired by the color scheme in the example site and kept that in mind.
